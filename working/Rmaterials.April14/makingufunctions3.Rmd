## User control of functions

Parameters in the function definition can be used to give users options that determine what calculations or actions are done in the function
(model)

This allows functions to be more flexible

Think of a model of ecosystem production that changes calculations if vegetation is grass versus a tree


Built in R functions do this alot - they allow users to specify methods (**glm** for example, alows family to set the type of model - binomical or gaussian) 

Here's an example

A function that estimates solar pv power given inputs of radiation

Model inputs: solar radiation (daily direct and diffuse)
Model outputs: power generated each year and average power over time
Parameters: panel efficiency, system performance, units, type of array (uses diffuse or not), plot Y/N

Some of these options such as whether to plot determine outputs from the function
AND the type of array to determine whether it uses diffuse radiation, 
these parameters change how the function/model works

```{r solar}
source("solarpv.R")
solarpv

# read in R formatted data
load("sierraczosolar.rda")

# already in the format required for the model
head(sierraczosolar)

# run the model
solarpv(area=0.1, solar=sierraczosolar, clr="green", eunit="W")

# run and save results - but don't plot
site1 = solarpv(area=0.1, solar=sierraczosolar, clr="green", eunit="W", g=FALSE)
site1$mean
site1$annual

# consider a different pv array that only uses 
# diffuse and has non standard efficiency (0.6)
site2 = solarpv(area=0.1, solar=sierraczosolar, clr="green", eunit="W", g=FALSE, eff=0.6, etype="direct")
site2$mean

# try some additional variations


# lets try sensitivity analysis again, this time by varying efficiency
# if we don't know efficiency exactly , lets try 20 samples
eff = rnorm(mean=0.6, sd = 0.1, n=20)
site2 = eff %>% map(~solarpv( area=0.1, solar=sierraczosolar, clr="green", eunit="W", g=FALSE, etype="direct", eff=.x ))

head(site2)
# this is pretty messy - but we can extract a useful data structure,lets say we want # just the annual data (not the mean), and then reformat as a data frame with nice column names
tmp = map_df(site2,`[`, c("annual")) 
site2df = data.frame(year = tmp$annual$year, elect= tmp$annual$elect)
# now we could plot
ggplot(site2df, aes(year,elect, group=year ))+geom_boxplot()

# we also might want an average across parameter uncertainty
site2_average = site2df %>% group_by(year) %>% summarize(elect=mean(elect))

```

## Building models with blocks - functions that call other functions


Functions can always embed other functions - and in models the output of one model may be the input to another

* loosely coupled models - output from one becomes input the other - but not necessarily automatic
* fully coupled - models exchange input sna outputs (feedback systems)

Develop a conceptual model

```{r  out.width="75%", out.height="75%", echo=FALSE }
library(knitr)
include_graphics("./power_comparison_figure.jpeg",) 
```


To start - lets create what we need to compute net present value of power facility
We will use output from our solarpv function as input into a function that
estimate profit given a price - and also 'calls' another function to compute 
net present value

```{r valuep}

source("../R/compute_NPV.R")
source("../R/compute_profit_frompower.R")

compute_profit_frompower

compute_NPV

# use solar from  site1 from above as input

profit_solar = compute_profit_frompower(energy=site2df$elect, year=site2df$year, price=30, discount=0.04)
profit_solar

ggplot(profit_solar, aes(year, netpre, group=year))+geom_boxplot()+labs(y="Profit in current $", x="year")

# notice that by graphing we identify an issue with the first year
# thoughts on what it might be
```

# Putting it all together

now lets add both of our functions (hydro and solar power), together with computing profit and sensitivity analysis to create a full picture of power options


Notice that we can 're-use' our functions such as **compute_profit_frompower** for both sources of power
(such as our reservoir power model) to build out our complete model

```{r reuse}

# rerun 'sampling' in using_data_with_functions.Rmd. above to get results from our reserovir model

# lets start with hydro power
source("../R/power_gen.R")

# we are 'making up' inputs for hydro power - to have it match the number of year 
# that we had solar values for, lets sets the number of runs equal to the number of years

number_runs = length(site2_average$year)

reservoir_model_res= as.data.frame(matrix(nrow=number_runs, ncol=3))
colnames(reservoir_model_res)=c("height","flow","power")

# STep 2 - generate heights and flow rates
reservoir_model_res$height = rnorm(mean=10, sd=1, n=number_runs)
reservoir_model_res$flow = runif(min=0.1, max=1, n=number_runs)

# Step 3 - generate uncertainty due to reservoir efficiency, lets assume that 
# we know its somewhere between 0.4 and 0.7
Keff = runif(min=0.4, max=0.7, n=20)

# Step 3 - apply model to get power for each height, flow rate (each year), across
# uncertainty in efficiency
res = Keff %>% map_dfc(~power_gen( height=reservoir_model_res$height, flow=reservoir_model_res$flow, Keff=.x) )
colnames(res)=Keff

head(res)

# add years - remember we are making up data for the same years that we have solar
res$year = site2_average$year

# reorganize for easier analysis 
resg=as.data.frame(res) %>% pivot_longer(!year,names_to="Keff", values_to="power")
head(res)

# create profit from hydro
profit_hydro = compute_profit_frompower(energy=resg$power, year= resg$year, price=30, discount=0.04)

names(profit_hydro)

# plot
ggplot(profit_hydro, aes(year, netpre, group=year))+geom_boxplot()

# compare with solar
a=ggplot(profit_hydro, aes(year, netpre, group=year))+geom_boxplot()+labs(title="Hydro",y="Net Present Values in 1945 Dollars", x="Year")
b=ggplot(profit_solar, aes(year, netpre, group=year))+geom_boxplot()+labs(title="Solar", y="Net Present Values in 1945 Dollars", x="Year")
ggarrange(a,b)

# put on one graph
ggplot(profit_hydro, aes(year, netpre, group=year))+geom_boxplot()+labs(y="Net Present Values in 1945 Dollars", x="Year", title="Both") +
  geom_boxplot(data=profit_solar, aes(year, netpre, group=year), fill="orange")

# or do get a nice legend
profit_hydro$etype="Hydro"
profit_solar$etype="Solar"
tmp = rbind.data.frame(profit_hydro, profit_solar)
ggplot(tmp, aes(as.factor(year), netpre, fill=etype))+geom_boxplot()+labs(y="Net Present Values in 1945 Dollars", x="Year", fill="Power Type")+scale_fill_manual(values=c("blue","orange"))

```
